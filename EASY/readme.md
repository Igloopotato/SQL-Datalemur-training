### [1. Page With No Likes](https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-page-with-no-likes)

Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.
Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:
There are no duplicates in the candidates table.


**candidates Example Input:**

ANSWER:


```sql
SELECT candidate_id FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python','PostgreSQL','Tableau')
GROUP BY candidate_id

### [3. Histogram of Tweets](https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-histogram-tweets)

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.
In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

**tweets Example Input:**
| tweet_id | user_id | msg                                                  | tweet_date          |

ANSWER:


```sql
SELECT 
  tweet_bucket, 
  COUNT(user_id) AS user_num 
FROM ( 
  SELECT 
  user_id, COUNT(msg) AS tweet_bucket FROM  tweets 
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '01/01/2022'  AND '12/31/2022'
  GROUP BY user_id 
      ) 
  AS Total_tweet
GROUP BY total_tweet.tweet_bucket;
```

| tweet_bucket | user_num |
|--------------|----------|
| 1            | 2        |
| 2            | 1        |

### [4. Unfinished Parts](https://datalemur.com/questions/tesla-unfinished-parts)

Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:
parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.

**tweets Example Input:**
| part    | finish_date         | assembly_step |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| battery | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| battery | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| battery | 03/22/2022 00:00:00 | 3             |
| bumper  | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| bumper  | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| bumper  |                     | 3             |
| bumper  |                     | 4             |


ANSWER:


```sql
SELECT part, assembly_step FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL;
```

| part   | assembly_step |
| ------ | ------------- |
| bumper | 3             |
| bumper | 4             |
| engine | 5             |

### [5. Laptop vs. Mobile Viewership](https://datalemur.com/questions/laptop-mobile-viewership)

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.
Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

**viewership Example Input:**
| user_id | device_type | view_time          |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| 123     | tablet      | 01/02/2022 00:00:00 |
| 125     | laptop      | 01/07/2022 00:00:00 |
| 128     | laptop      | 02/09/2022 00:00:00 |
| 129     | phone       | 02/09/2022 00:00:00 |
| 145     | tablet      | 02/24/2022 00:00:00 |

ANSWER:


```sql
SELECT
COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type = 'laptop') AS laptop_views,
COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone')) AS mobile_views
FROM Viewership;


----OTHER METHOD BUT HARDER----
ALTER TABLE Viewership
ADD new_device_type TEXT;

UPDATE Viewership
SET new_device_type =
  CASE
    WHEN device_type = 'phone' THEN 'mobile'
    WHEN device_type = 'tablet' THEN 'mobile'
    ELSE device_type
  END;

SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN new_device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN new_device_type = 'mobile' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views
FROM Viewership;
```

| laptop_views | mobile_views |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 2            | 3            |
